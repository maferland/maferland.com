## 🌙 Special Features

**Theme Toggle Animation** — The moon rotates to show its "dark side" when switching to dark mode. A small detail that brings personality to the interface.

**Animated Navigation** — Links feature smooth underline animations and subtle hover states that feel responsive and polished.

**Performance First** — Static generation, optimized images, and minimal JavaScript for fast loading.
